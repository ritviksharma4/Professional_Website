An [AWS Cloud Platform at Barclays]() called NGCB (Next Gen Consumer Banking). 
This platform is the first step towards Cloud for Barclays and we had a mega successful launch and my [Multi-Domain Log Processing Engine]() was pivotal in fast error resolution for a seamless customer experience by reducing resolution times by [around 75%]()!
